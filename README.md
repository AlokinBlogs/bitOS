This is the official repository of the alokinBlogs bitOS multifunctional program for the BBC micro:bit board. It contains the file as a .HEX, .JS, and as source code, which can be edited to your liking.

bitOS is an educational program that can help people who are having difficulties with basic and more complex JavaScript commands, and it's made to act like an essential program for a micro:bit Go with functions like a compass, a thermometer and other perks, which are not that essential, like animations, melodies and other things.

FAQ:

1. To see the source code, please look for a folder named "Source Code". Open it. Once you have opened it, you will see the code in JavaScript and in Python. I recommend editing the file in JavaScript, as the original code was wriiten in that language. Python is a translated version, which might not work as intended on some devices, but is made to be able to work. 

2. If you have edited the code and want to upload it as a .HEX file, please copy your code in the Microsoft MakeCode editor, and select the language they you have coded it in. Name your file with the following letters: bOS-vED-yourprojectname. This shows that you have edited this, and allows you to receive independence on your program.
